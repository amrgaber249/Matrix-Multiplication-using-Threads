# Matrix-Multiplication-using-Threads

## Problem Statement:
It is required to implement an algorithm as multi-threaded one.
## Matrix Multiplication
### It is required to implement two variations of this algorithm:
a) The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread.
b) The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.
For both variations, you have to compute the elapsed time for each of them and compare them.

The program should read two input matrices in a certain format as mentioned in the “matrix-readme.txt” file associated with project (Output format is also mentioned).
